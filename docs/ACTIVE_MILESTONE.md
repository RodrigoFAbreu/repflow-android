# Active Milestone

## Milestone

All roadmap milestones (0-8) are **complete**. Milestone 8 (post-MVP
functional usability stabilization) is accepted and closed under an
explicit user waiver of its planned functional-review gate — see
"Functional review disposition" below.

## Goal

Milestone 8 closed the functional/usability gaps in
`docs/milestones/completed/milestone-8-reference.md`'s "Goals" section:
Recovery/futsal date/scale/history/save-feedback fixes, workout/plan
set-classification and start-from-plan wiring, History filtering and safe
accidental-workout removal, training-plan archive/restore, navigation
consistency, and backup hardening.

## Current checkpoint

**Milestone 8 accepted and complete.** All checkpoints (P0, CP0-CP16)
implemented and committed; full checkpoint-by-checkpoint detail is
preserved in git history for this file up to `dc4381a` and in the
archived plan docs.

- Implementation review: **approved** (round 4, `APPROVE` — no new
  blocking/important finding; rounds 1-3 findings all resolved).
- Integration: **complete** — `dc4381a` (last implementation-review-round
  commit) is reachable from `main` via merge `b39af90`, verified by
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor` before this doc update.
- Functional review: **waived** by explicit user decision — not
  performed, and not claimed to have passed. See "Functional review
  disposition" below.
- Milestone status: **accepted/complete**.

## Functional review disposition

The manual functional-review checklist prepared at CP16 (23 numbered
flows covering navigation, Recovery/futsal, workout/plan wiring, History,
archive/restore, and backup) was written and is preserved in git history
at `dc4381a`, but was never walked by the user on a device.

On 2026-07-31 the user explicitly accepted and closed Milestone 8 while
waiving that review, stating explicitly this is a user-authorized waiver,
not a claim that functional review passed. Stated reasons:

- technical implementation and external implementation review are
  complete;
- the implementation is integrated into `main`;
- the user is postponing detailed UI/UX validation;
- future UI/UX work will be handled as a separate, later, Figma-led
  redesign milestone.

## Current blockers

None. Milestone 8 is accepted and closed. No roadmap milestone is
currently active.

## Active plan

None active. Milestone 8's plans are archived at
`docs/milestones/completed/milestone-8-{execution,reference}.md`.
Milestones 1-7 remain archived alongside them.

## Next action

No further roadmap milestone is currently defined — `docs/ROADMAP.md`
0-8 are all complete. `docs/improvements/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md` §2.1
(`ReturnCount` tuning) was deferred pending Milestone 8's acceptance and
is now unblocked, but has not been started or scheduled. The
user has indicated the next substantive product work will be a separate
Figma-led UI/UX redesign milestone; it has not been planned or scoped in
this repository. Do not begin it and do not run `/milestone-plan` until
the user explicitly initiates that work.

## `workflow-v2-1-core` — functional review checklist (implementation revision 4)

This section is unrelated to the roadmap/Milestone 8 content above. It
tracks the separate, non-product process work item `workflow-v2-1-core`
(see `docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_V2_PLAN.md`,
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`), currently at
`AWAITING_FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW` per `docs/ai-workflow/MILESTONE_WORKFLOW.md`.

**Context**: checkpoint `WF8b` (manual multi-session dry run) began
against the synthetic work item `v2-1-dry-run`, but its first scenario
(S1) blocked before any mutation on a real defect:
`scripts/workflow_fingerprint.py`'s `--work-item-id` flag affected only
which bundle directory was written to — every actual identity/content
computation silently hardcoded `workflow-v2-1-core`'s own metadata
regardless of the flag (see
`docs/ai-workflow/dry-run/WF8B_S1_FINDING_review_content_id_not_generalized.md`).
That defect was fixed as continued WF8b scope under a revised plan
(Revision 21), went through five rounds of external implementation
review (`GPT-R30` through `GPT-R34`, all resolved), and now has
`technical_approval` recorded for implementation revision 4
(`8f9ea8cc60192bbbecfb7ed092c1dc79739047c7616ea4e2cddd8b68ecd0c9ed`,
commit `7bef596`). `WF8b` itself is **not yet complete** — this
functional review gates only the fingerprint-generalization fix, which
must pass before scenario S1 can be safely rerun.

### Setup

No Android app / Gradle changes are involved — this is process tooling
only (`scripts/*.py`, `scripts/prepare-ai-review.sh`,
`docs/ai-workflow/*`, `.claude/commands/*.md`). No build/install step is
needed; everything below runs with `python3` from the repo root.

### Automated verification (already re-confirmed this session, current)

All green, re-run independently right before this checklist was written
(no source/test file has changed since `technical_approval` was
recorded — the last commit, `ae51770`, is metadata-only):

| Suite | Tests |
|---|---|
| `scripts/workflow_fingerprint_test.py` | 122/122 |
| `scripts/workflow_fingerprint_generalization_test.py` | 51/51 |
| `scripts/workflow_state_test.py` | 221/221 |
| `scripts/workflow_integration_test.py` | 35/35 |
| `scripts/workflow_test_harness_test.py` | 19/19 |

Total: 448/448. (`workflow_fingerprint_demo_test.py` has pre-existing,
unrelated failures against real-repository paths outside this item's
scope — documented as such since the `GPT-R32` round; not part of this
review.)

### Test data

None to seed — all checks below read this repository's own real,
already-committed state (`workflow-v2-1-core` and the dormant
`v2-1-dry-run`/`milestone-8` entries already in
`docs/ai-workflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json`).

### Flows to exercise manually

1. **Fix confirmed — generic CLI now resolves the real item correctly.**
   Run:
   ```
   python3 scripts/workflow_fingerprint.py --work-item-id workflow-v2-1-core 162154d3e5e10eb65e109833acae4b4fb01fc5d6
   ```
   Expected: prints `work_item_id: workflow-v2-1-core`,
   `review_content_id: b6d4ea6a8778321526fa5a3a6d2af17801f6187fd137680bbef8cce008ef95c0`
   (matches `plan_approval.approved_review_content_id` exactly). Already
   re-run this session — passed.
2. **Fix confirmed — no more silent cross-item fallback.** Run:
   ```
   python3 scripts/workflow_fingerprint.py --work-item-id v2-1-dry-run
   ```
   Expected: fails closed with `MissingPlanStageMetadataError:
   v2-1-dry-run.registry_path is null` — naming `v2-1-dry-run` itself,
   not silently substituting `workflow-v2-1-core`'s own data (the
   original S1 defect). Already re-run this session — passed.
3. **Default resolution still targets the live active item.** Run the
   same command with no `--work-item-id` at all; expect the identical
   error (since `active_work_item_id` is currently `v2-1-dry-run`),
   confirming the documented "omitted resolves to
   `active_work_item_id`" default. Already re-run this session — passed.
4. **Re-run the automated suite yourself** (table above) and confirm the
   same 448/448 result independently, rather than trusting this
   document's claim alone.
5. **Spot-check the migration**: confirm
   `docs/ai-workflow/registry/workflow-v2-1-core-artifacts.json` is
   `schema_version: 2` with both `plan_stage` and `implementation_stage`
   keys present.

### Expected result

All five checks above pass exactly as described; no step requires any
write to the real repository (all read-only), so this review can be
repeated freely.

### Known limitations / out of scope for this review

- This review does **not** cover `WF8b` itself — the dry run's S1
  through S17 scenarios remain unexecuted and are explicitly deferred to
  a fresh session per `docs/ai-workflow/dry-run/WF8B_SCENARIOS.md`.
- Item 160 (see `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`'s "Accepted, not fully
  closed" section) is the process obligation this review partially
  discharges (suite green, confirmed above) — the other half (a
  fresh-session S1 re-attempt) happens after this review, not during it.
- A handful of named test sub-cases remain partial, not absent (see
  `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`'s "Accepted, not fully closed this pass"
  list) — not blocking for this functional review.

Findings go in `.ai-review/workflow-v2-1-core/feedback/FUNCTIONAL_REVIEW.md`.

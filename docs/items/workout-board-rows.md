Workout board rows: `Last time` and logged summaries

**Complexity:** low. **Tier:** 4. Match the approved design.

One milestone and one squash-merged pull request, releasable alone: the plan's pull request title must be a conventional commit (`fix:` for a correction, `feat:` for something new). The merge then publishes a GitHub Release with the APK; nothing in the repository holds a version number.

**Needs first:** `design-3-redraws`.

## App findings

- **Workout board rows** [A-22, D154] · S. No `Last time` line or logged-sets summary, and the context line differs. Evidence: `WorkoutBoard.kt:269-310`, board 20a.

## Rules

The plan's header must carry exactly one line of this form, with nothing after the closing backtick: ``Pull request title: `fix: what changed` ``. See `AGENTS.md`, "Running under the Controller".

Evidence comes from the 2026-11-04 council; re-check it against today's code before relying on a line number. Ids such as `A-1` and `D-1` refer to its findings, kept in the lane's council folder. Keep the item small: one new mechanism at most, and split it before its first review if it needs two.
